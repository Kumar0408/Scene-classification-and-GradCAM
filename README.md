## Classification of scene images using CNN and interpreting the results using Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Mapping(Grad-CAM)
Framework : Keras-Tensorflow

- Built the resnet18 from sctratch using residual blocks and convolutional blocks
- Trained model on scene images (buildings, forest, sea, mountain, glacier, street)
- Evaluated on test images
- Implemented GRAD-CAM and imposed the obtained activation maps on the original image.
